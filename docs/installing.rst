Installing
----------

This project is based on python (2.7 or 2.6) and python libraries, as specified in
:file:``requirements.txt``. On a posix platform with pip_,
it is possible to satisfy the prerequisites with
``pip install --egg "scons>=2.4";pip install -r requirements.txt``. However, some requirements may be
demanding. On a linux platform, you might need to install development
tools and ``xmllib2-devel``, ``xmllint2-devel`` beforehand. On a MacOS
platform, you would need development tools, either through XCode_ or standalone.
(Availale here_ for versions of OS X older than 10.8.)

Once the requirements are satisfied, including
scons_, you would first bootstrap the data files
with ``scons``, and then it is possible to do a normal
``python setup.py install``. This process will hopefully be streamlined
in the near future.

It is also possible to create a single-file executable with pyinstaller_. Pre-built packages are available for Windows_ and MacOSX_.

Installing this package installs two scripts: lom2mlr and
lom2mlr\_markdown. The latter is used to create the rationale.html file,
which explains design choices. The command to do so is
``lom2mlr_markdown -l -c rationale.md``.
